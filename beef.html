<h2> Slow Cooked Pot Roast </h2>
  <body>
    Dust off that crockpot. Serves 8. Or just one guy eating tender beef for days. I am using my favorite cooking blog's recipe, which can be found <a href="http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/2011/10/classic-slow-cooker-beef-pot-roast.html">here</a>.
  </center> <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 lbs beef chuck roast, preferably with bone</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons flour, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>8 oz sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>3 medium carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
      <li>1 sprig rosemary</li>
      <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Directions </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the chopped carrots and celery into the slow cooker.
        <li>Season roast generously with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour on both sides and pat into meat. Shake off excess flour.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Sear the roast on both sides for about 6 minutes each, or until well browned. Place meat on top of celery and carrots.</li>
        <li>Back to the skillet, reduce heat to medium. Stir in mushrooms and butter; cook for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in onion; cook onions until translucent and begin to brown; about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook for a minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in half of flour; cook for about a minute. Stir in tomato paste; cook for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Add chicken stock, mix well. Cook until simmer, then remove from heat. </li>
        <li>Pour delicious gravy mixture over beef in slow cooker. Add rosemary and thyme.</li>
        <li>Cover slow cooker. Cook on high for 6 hours, or until meat is as tender as you prefer.</li>
        <li>Skim off any fat during the cooking process and remove any bones. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
      </ol>

      I serve over mashed potatoes, but goes great over rice or by itself.
